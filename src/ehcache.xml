        This cache contains a maximum in memory of 10000 elements, and will expire
        an element if it is idle for more than 5 minutes and lives for more than
        10 minutes.

        disk cache, which in this configuration will go to wherever java.io.tmp is
        defined on your system. On a standard Linux system this will be /tmp"
